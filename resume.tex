\section{Experience}

\cventry{Jun 2020--Present}{HPC Software Engineer}{Oak Ridge National Laboratory}{National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS)}{}{
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Federated Learning on AMD GPUs:} Enabled NVFLARE on ROCm/MI250X with PyTorch (ROCm); replaced CUDA-bound dependencies with ROCm/HIP-compatible builds, packaged deterministic ROCm containers, and integrated with Slurm using mTLS in secure enclaves; validated multi-node rounds across multiple nodes/GPUs, unblocking research teams and reducing vendor lock-in
\item \textbf{myOLCF Portal Ownership:} Self-service \& monitoring portal serving researchers across multiple projects with 99.9\%+ availability; 12 production deployments in FY2025
\item \textbf{Platform Performance:} Migrated to Vite + CI tuning → builds reduced from ~2 min to 9s (-92\%), server startup from 30s to <200ms (-99\%), unit tests from 90s to 6s (-93\%); significantly reduced development wait time
\item \textbf{Runtime Performance:} Improved portal responsiveness 71.8\% (2021) and 155\% (2023) via query batching, read-through caching, and front-end optimizations
\item \textbf{Smart Facility Metrics Backend:} Designed \& implemented ingestion of compute/data/I/O/benchmark-efficiency metrics and exposed via APIs + myOLCF; adopted by multiple teams for capacity tuning and anomaly detection
\item \textbf{Reliability \& Features:} Delivered filesystem-usage reporting (including AFW-specific reports), V5 access endpoints, and RATS via proxy across enclaves; resolved service-proxy enclave routing defects
\item \textbf{Security \& Compliance:} Contributed to Scalable Protected Infrastructure (SPI); built middleware routing demographics to PII-compliant ITSD database; shipped obfuscated production bundles
\item \textbf{Data Correctness \& Operations:} Added ability to change project app's reserved project ID and recurring mapping job; reduced manual corrections/tickets significantly
\item \textbf{Quality Assurance:} Cut post-deploy incidents to 0 over recent releases by expanding Cypress/feature coverage and tightening parameter validation
\item \textbf{Leadership:} Mentored interns/junior engineers and authored runbooks/SLOs + incident playbooks; reduced MTTR significantly
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{Jun--Aug 2019}{ML Engineer Intern}{Bank of America}{Consumer, Small Business \& Wealth Tech}{}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Built NLP entity extraction service (names/phones/addresses/accounts/amounts) achieving 96\% F1 score, supporting \$20M+/yr in savings through automation
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{May 2015--May 2019}{Software Developer Intern}{Oak Ridge National Laboratory}{National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS)}{}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Year-round development of HPC-centric services, applications, and BI tools; shipped production features across internal portals
\item Automated supercomputer access communications via policy-aware email system; standardized messaging and reduced manual steps
\item Built WordPress/REST plugin to sync \& display HPC metrics on olcf.ornl.gov; improved data freshness and reduced update toil
\end{itemize}}
